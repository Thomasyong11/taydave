Build a Vercel-ready marketing site for ROFIC – Ring of Fire Infrastructure Consultants.

Tech/Hosting requirements:

Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript

Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (Button, Card, Badge, Input, Textarea, NavigationMenu)

ESLint + Prettier; Node 18+

Static by default with ISR for any dynamic pages (revalidate 3600).

Include /sitemap.xml and /robots.txt routes.

Add Vercel Analytics and @vercel/og for a dynamic /api/og image.

Simple /api/contact route that emails via Resend if RESEND_API_KEY is set; otherwise logs to server (no external calls required).

Provide .env.example with RESEND_API_KEY, NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL.

Add a minimal vercel.json (clean URLs, trailingSlash=false).

Brand & tone:

We are consultants/coordination, not builders. Neutral, credible, government-friendly.

Palette: deep navy (#0F1C2E), slate gray (#334155), white, subtle gold accent (#D4AF37).

Fonts: Inter or Lato.

Imagery: Northern Ontario landscapes, meeting rooms, roadways; avoid heavy construction shots.

Navigation: Home, Services, Partner Network, Why ROFIC, Insights, Contact. Sticky header with logo left, “Partner With Us” button right.

Pages/sections (content placeholders OK):

Home (/)

Hero: “Connecting Vision, Policy, and Progress.”
Sub: “ROFIC helps governments and investors coordinate infrastructure, permitting, and partnerships for Ontario’s Ring of Fire.”
Buttons: Primary “Partner With Us”, Secondary “Learn More”.

“Our Role” cards (shadcn Cards):
• Policy & Strategy Alignment • Indigenous Partnership Facilitation • Contractor & Vendor Network Access • Feasibility & Environmental Coordination • Funding & Grant Advisory

Credibility strip with small text bullets: “Neutral advisory • Government collaboration • Community-first approach”.

Services (/services)

Sections with icons + short copy: Infrastructure Readiness, Regulatory & Environmental Guidance, Partnership & Engagement Strategy, Investment & Funding Advisory, Impact & Benefits Planning, Coordination Support.

Clear note: “ROFIC acts as advisor/connector; delivery is performed by partner firms.”

Partner Network (/partners)

Grid of placeholder partner categories (Engineering, Environmental, PMO, Indigenous-owned contractors).

Copy about vetting and matching: “connecting the right people to the right opportunities.”

Why ROFIC (/why-rofic)

Proof points: neutrality, public-sector literacy, risk awareness, transparent process.

Small FAQ (3–5 items) in an accordion.

Insights (/insights)

Static blog index with 3 sample posts (markdown MDX ready).

Each post uses ISR and shares the same OG image template.

Contact (/contact)

Form using react-hook-form + zod: Organization, Name, Email, Project Type (select), Message.

Submit to /api/contact; show success/error toasts.

Include privacy note (no selling data).

SEO & metadata:

Default metadata in app/layout.tsx:

title: “ROFIC – Ring of Fire Infrastructure Consultants”

description: “Consulting and coordination for Ontario’s Ring of Fire—aligning funding, policy, and partnerships.”

keywords: Ring of Fire Ontario consultants, infrastructure advisory Northern Ontario, government coordination firm, Indigenous engagement consultants, critical minerals project management, Ontario funding partnerships

OpenGraph + Twitter cards; canonical from NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL.

Add /api/og route that renders title + subtitle over a landscape background.

Footer: company blurb, quick links, contact email placeholder hello@rofic.ca, and small disclaimer: “ROFIC provides consulting/coordination services and does not perform construction.”

DX / Ready to deploy:

README.md with:

pnpm i (or npm/yarn)

copy .env.example → .env.local

pnpm dev

push to GitHub and Deploy to Vercel (build: next build)

Include sample env and note to set NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL to the Vercel domain.

Copy tone: short sentences, professional, no buzzwords, no claims of direct delivery. Keep text friendly to government and Indigenous partners.
